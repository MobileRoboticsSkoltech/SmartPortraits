Dataset toolkit is a collection of useful information and scripts that acompany our dataset. First, it keeps information about dataset structure and platform calibration parameters. Second, it provides scripts for unpacking data from its raw format: decode smartphone video to frames, assign common synchronized timestamps for data from all platform parties. Third, it provides conversion scripts to convert data to TUM, ASL and ASL-ROS format. Toolkit is available in our <a href="https://github.com/MobileRoboticsSkoltech/SmartPortraits-toolkit">GitHub repository</a>.
